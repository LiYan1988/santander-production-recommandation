Then, we built separate models for Jun and May, but the ensemble didn’t work. We weren’t surprised because June data is better for seasonal products, and May data is better for trend products. And vice-versa, June data is bad for trend products and May data is bad for seasonal products. So, they sort of cancelled each other out.\n",
