    "- A hacky implementation of MAP@7 evaluation. \n",

    "- This method **only works if the MAP functions and training codes are in the same notebook**.\n",
    "- The MAP values shown during training is averaged by the number of customers with new products, so very different from LB. But it gives a sense of if the algorithm is good or not.\n",

Then, we built separate models for Jun and May, but the ensemble didn’t work. We weren’t surprised because June data is better for seasonal products, and May data is better for trend products. And vice-versa, June data is bad for trend products and May data is bad for seasonal products. So, they sort of cancelled each other out.\n",
